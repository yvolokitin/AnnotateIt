This file contains the necessary changes to make the app compatible with macOS:

1. In lib/widgets/camera/camera_capture_widget.dart:

   a. Line 311 (in _takePicture method):
      Change:
      ```dart
      if (kIsWeb || Platform.isWindows) {
      ```
      To:
      ```dart
      if (kIsWeb || Platform.isWindows || Platform.isMacOS) {
      ```

   b. Line 381 (in build method):
      Change:
      ```dart
      if (kIsWeb || Platform.isWindows) {
      ```
      To:
      ```dart
      if (kIsWeb || Platform.isWindows || Platform.isMacOS) {
      ```

   c. Line 466 (in build method):
      Change:
      ```dart
      if (Platform.isWindows) ...[
      ```
      To:
      ```dart
      if (Platform.isWindows || Platform.isMacOS) ...[
      ```

   d. Line 533 (in build method):
      Change:
      ```dart
      if (Platform.isWindows) ...[
      ```
      To:
      ```dart
      if (Platform.isWindows || Platform.isMacOS) ...[
      ```

2. The _initializeCamera method (line 74) already includes macOS handling:
   ```dart
   if (Platform.isWindows || Platform.isMacOS) {
   ```
   So no change is needed there.

These changes will ensure that the app properly handles macOS platform-specific code, preventing crashes when running on macOS. The main issue was that the camera functionality had special handling for Windows but not for macOS, which could cause the app to crash when trying to use the camera on macOS.
